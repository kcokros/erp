# Extended Research Project on Media Narratives of Capital City Relocation

This repository contains the code and data for the Extended Research Project (ERP) exploring the evolving media narratives surrounding the capital city relocation in Indonesia. The project employs an ensemble of three methodologies to analyze media coverage: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, BERT and RoBERTa algorithms for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and sentiment analysis. These methodologies aim to track the evolution of media discourse, identify key influencers, assess public sentiment, and highlight coverage gaps and biases.

## Objectives

1. **Track the Media Discourse Evolution**: 
   - Identify prominent topics and track their change over time through temporal analysis.
   - Detect the emergence, change, or dissolution of discourse clusters.

2. **Identify Key Influencers**: 
   - Determine the key influencers within the media discourse on the capital city relocation to IKN.
   - Identify key persons, their roles/occupations, and their affiliations (government or non-government).

3. **Assess Public Sentiment**: 
   - Conduct sentiment analysis to determine the overall tone (positive, negative, or neutral) of the coverage.
   - Identify shifts in public opinion as reflected in the media.

4. **Highlight Coverage Gaps and Biases**: 
   - Analyze significant coverage gaps or biases in the media portrayal of the capital relocation project.
   - Provide recommendations for more inclusive, balanced, and community-aligned future media coverage.

## Data Collection

The dataset for this research was gathered through a database under the Indonesian Ministry of Finance, providing mass media and news data for Public Relations officers. The dataset was filtered using a Boolean search query focusing on Indonesiaâ€™s IKN. The dataset consists of the following columns:

- `Date`: Date of the news article.
- `Time`: Time when the system captured the news.
- `Title`: Title of the news article.
- `Summary`: Summary of the news article generated by the system.

## Methodologies and Code Structure

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing

**Code Location:** `erp.ipynb` under "INITIAL EDA," "PREPROCESS," and "SECOND EDA"

- Filters the dataset to include only the 16 media sources specified in the main report and removes the `Time` column.
- Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focuses on general distribution, missing values, and duplicates.
- A second EDA examines temporal fluctuations and the current state of the data.
- Preprocessing creates columns for non-lemmatized and lemmatized tokenized text for further analysis, generating `Cleaned_Title`, `Cleaned_Summary`, and `text` which is created from `Title` + `Summary`, along with `text_tokenised` and `text_tokenised_stemmed`

### Topic Modelling

**Code Location:** `erp.ipynb` under "LDA MODELLING"

- Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover hidden topics.
- Trains LDA models with different numbers of topics (2 to 15) to identify the best number of clusters, using `text_tokenised_stemmed` column
- Saves the optimal model, which has 9 clusters, for further analysis.
- Adds a `topic` column to the dataset to assign the dominant topic to each row.

### Named Entity Recognition

**Code Location:** `erp.ipynb` under "NER MODELLING"

- Generates a dictionary of actor-role pairs mentioned in the news dataset.
- Applies the best-performing NER model to the dataset, focusing on the `Cleaned_Summary` column.
- Associates individuals (PER) with their roles (NOR) or organizations (ORG).
- Combined with manual analysis through multiple iteration to build a dictionary of `Influencer` and `Role`, which will be cross referenced with the dataset to generate `Extracted_Influencers`
- Introduces model to determine whether an individual is affiliated with the government or a non-government entity, adding `bias_score` to the dataset (+1 for each government key person mentioned in `Extracted_Influencers`, and -1 of each non-government key person mentioned)

### Sentiment Analysis

**Code Location:** `erp.ipynb` under "SA MODELLING"

- Predicts the sentiment of the news titles using a fine-tuned model trained on a manually labeled dataset.
- Due to large file size, the `model.safetensor` is not uploaded, but the `LABELED_SA.csv` used for training is available.
- Adds `Tone` to the dataset, which reflects the sentiment of the news article

## Discussion Sections

### Topic Modelling Results

**Code Location:** `erp.ipynb` under "ANALYSIS -> OVERALL TOPICS"

- Descriptive names are assigned to LDA-identified topics for readability.
- Consistent color coding is applied to visually differentiate topics across plots.
- adds `topic_name` to dataset by determining the name of `topic` through the most prominent keywords

### Named Entity Recognition Results

**Code Location:** `erp.ipynb` under "ANALYSIS -> OVERALL INFLUENCER"

- Analyzes the distribution of entities mentioned per article, focusing on the number of key people identified.
- Visualizes the number of influencers per article and grouping articles mentioning four or more people into one bin.

### Sentiment Analysis Results

**Code Location:** `erp.ipynb` under "ANALYSIS -> OVERALL TONE"

- Counts the frequency of each sentiment tone in the dataset and visualizes it as a pie chart.

### Overall Media Landscape

**Code Location:** `erp.ipynb` under "ANALYSIS -> MEDIA LANDSCAPE"

- Analyzes the media landscape over time, examining topic movement, tone, and bias.
- Highlights key events to provide context to the observed trends.

### Positive vs. Negative News Spikes

**Code Location:** `erp.ipynb` under "ANALYSIS -> TOPIC FLUCTUATION"

- Analyzes spikes in news coverage across topics, focusing on positive and negative tones.
- Identifies prominent keywords, tones, and affiliations during spikes.
- Uses Jaccard similarity to compare keyword overlap in positive vs. negative spikes.
- Visualizes monthly fluctuations of topics over time, highlighting significant peaks in coverage.
